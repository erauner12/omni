# Due to an incompatibility between Cilium BPF host routing and Talos DNS forwarding, forwardKubeDNSToHost must be set to false.
# Otherwise, CoreDNS will stop working. The alternative is to force Cilium to use legacy routing via bpf.hostLegacyRouting=true, 
# but this is not recommended because BPF routing is much more efficient. (See: https://cilium.io/blog/2021/05/11/cni-benchmark/)
